# BathHack

### Inspiration
Our aim was to gamify everyday activity to encourage users to stay fit & healthy.

### What it does
The app chooses a random nearby location as a destination. Users must reach the destination while avoiding the hazards randomly marked on the map.

### How we built it
- Using Java & XML through Android Studio
- Designed mockups using Figma

### Challenges we ran into
- Handling the Google Maps API
- Converting glassmorphism from Figma to Android Studio

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Well-designed
- Fun-concept

### What we learned
- Google API documentation is lacking and poorly organised

### What's next for GeoQuest
- Incorporate more hazards
- Add customisation options to allow the user to set an approximate destination distance
- Multiplayer feature to allow users to compete with each other
- Animations & sound
